### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**No**](https://noemi-portfolio-ten.vercel.app), a computer scientist.

I'm focused on learning how everything works in practice, creating projects and solving real-world problems.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My current tech stack includes Python, C, Java, Javascript and React. My favorite tools are Figma, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, Vercel and Notion.

I have several academic and personal projects pinned here, all built as part of my learning journey.

I’m always open to learning opportunities, collaborations, and internships.

#### About Me:
* I enjoy reading and playing RPG games  
* I like learning new things outside my comfort zone  
* I value consistency more than speed  
* **Hobbies:** technology, storytelling, and creative projects
